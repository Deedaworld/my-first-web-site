    <h2>Welcome to Dee's Movie World</h2>
    <p>"Movies can and do have tremendous influence in shaping young lives in the realm of entertainment towards the ideals and objectives of normal adulthood." - <strong>Walt Disney</strong></p>

    <p style="margin-top:40px;"> Before we have access to 'web,' the only way peole can share their experiences or knowledges was that we have to have physical contacts - either meeting in-person or reading books at libraries. However, now we are in the middle of the ocean of information.</p>
    <p><strong>The problem is, how people can distinguish their own opinion or the "agreement" on others' opinion?</strong><br>Are you sure that what you are thinking is from your own background? Or do you think that hence your thoughts are from others' opinion - youtube, blog, reels, or some other methods?</p>
    <p>This is why I started to create the logs! I'll introduce all the experiencse that I had, and share my thoughts on here. Let's compare, talk, play, and love what we human beings perceive here!</p>
